This project uses the rich Spring Boot environment to provide a secure, scalable, and high-performance backend API. The key technology and features are:

-----> Spring Web MVC powers the main RESTful API structure that handles HTTP requests and responses.

-----> Spring Data JPA: Provides seamless and efficient interface with relational databases using ORM.

-----> Spring Security with JWT enables safe authentication and role-based authorization via JSON Web Tokens.

-----> Spring DevTools: Improves developer productivity by automating restarts and live reloads throughout development.

-----> Redis uses an in-memory caching layer to boost performance and reduce database load.
